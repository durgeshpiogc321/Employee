## Security Analysis Process

### **Step 1: Initial Security Scan**
1. **Git Diff Analysis**: Review all changed files for security implications
2. **Vulnerability Identification**: Scan for common security weaknesses
3. **OWASP Mapping**: Categorize findings against OWASP Top 10

### **Step 2: Comprehensive Project Review**
1. **Architecture Assessment**: Evaluate overall security architecture
2. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Review security-related code patterns
3. **Configuration Review**: Analyze security configurations and settings
4. **Dependency Audit**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### **Step 3: Detailed Security Reporting**
1. **Risk Prioritization**: Categorize findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
2. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze potential business and technical impact
3. **Remediation Guidance**: Provide specific fix recommendations
4. **Compliance Mapping**: Map findings to regulatory requirements
