## Enhanced Optimization Patterns

### **üîÑ Async/Await Conversion**
```csharp
// ‚ùå Before: Synchronous blocking operation
public Employee GetEmployee(int id)
{
    var employee = _repository.GetEmployee(id);
    return employee;
}

// ‚úÖ After: Asynchronous non-blocking operation
public async Task<Employee> GetEmployeeAsync(int id)
{
    var employee = await _repository.GetEmployeeAsync(id);
    return employee;
}
```

### **‚ö° LINQ Performance Enhancement**
```csharp
// ‚ùå Before: Multiple inefficient enumerations
public List<Employee> GetActiveEmployeesWithDetails(List<Employee> employees)
{
    var active = employees.Where(e => e.IsActive).ToList();
    var withDetails = active.Where(e => e.Details != null).ToList();
    return withDetails.OrderBy(e => e.Name).ToList();
}

// ‚úÖ After: Single optimized enumeration
public List<Employee> GetActiveEmployeesWithDetails(List<Employee> employees)
{
    return employees
        .Where(e => e.IsActive && e.Details != null)
        .OrderBy(e => e.Name)
        .ToList();
}
```

### **üß† Memory Management Optimization**
```csharp
// ‚ùå Before: Memory leaks and inefficient disposal
public void ProcessEmployeeData()
{
    var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    var command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection);
    // ... processing without proper disposal
}

// ‚úÖ After: Proper resource management
public async Task ProcessEmployeeDataAsync()
{
    using var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    using var command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection);
    await connection.OpenAsync();
    // Automatic disposal and async operations
}
```

### **üöÄ CPU Optimization**
```csharp
// ‚ùå Before: O(n¬≤) complexity with nested loops
public List<Employee> FindDuplicateEmployees(List<Employee> employees)
{
    var duplicates = new List<Employee>();
    for (int i = 0; i < employees.Count; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < employees.Count; j++)
        {
            if (employees[i].Email == employees[j].Email)
                duplicates.Add(employees[i]);
        }
    }
    return duplicates;
}

// ‚úÖ After: O(n) complexity with HashSet
public List<Employee> FindDuplicateEmployees(List<Employee> employees)
{
    var seen = new HashSet<string>();
    var duplicates = new List<Employee>();
    
    foreach (var employee in employees)
    {
        if (!seen.Add(employee.Email))
            duplicates.Add(employee);
    }
    return duplicates;
}
```
